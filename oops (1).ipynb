    "Abstraction is one of the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that helps to hide complex implementation details and only expose necessary information or functionality to the user. Abstraction allows you to create a simplified interface that reduces the complexity of code and makes it easier to use.\n",

    "In Python, you can achieve abstraction by using abstract classes and abstract methods. An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated, meaning you cannot create objects from it.

    "Abstraction and Encapsulation are two important concepts in Object-Oriented Programming. Although they are related, they are distinct concepts with different purposes.\n",

    "Abstraction refers to the process of hiding the implementation details of an object and exposing only the essential features to the user. It focuses on \"what\" the object does, rather than \"how\" it does it. This allows users to interact with the object without having to know its internal workings. Abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.\n",

    "Encapsulation refers to the practice of bundling data and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit. It is the practice of keeping the internal state of an object hidden from the outside world and providing access to it only through public methods.
